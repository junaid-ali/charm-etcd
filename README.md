# Etcd

Etcd is a highly available distributed key value store that provides a reliable
way to store data across a cluster of machines. Etcd gracefully handles master
elections during network partitions and will tolerate machine failure, including
the master.

Your applications can read and write data into etcd. A simple use-case is to
store database connection details or feature flags in etcd as key value pairs.
These values can be watched, allowing your app to reconfigure itself when they
change.

Advanced uses take advantage of the consistency guarantees to implement
database master elections or do distributed locking across a cluster of workers.

Etcd allows storing data in a distributed hierarchical database with observation.

## Usage

We can deploy a single node easily with

    juju deploy cs:~kubernetes/trusty/etcd

Add and capacity with:

    juju add-unit -n 2 etcd

Its recommended to run an odd number of machines as it has greater redundancy than
even number (ie. 4, you can lose 1 before quorum is lost, where as 5, you can 2).



## Health

Health of the cluster can be checked by verified via juju run

    juju run --service=etcd ./health


## Known Limitations

During Etcd cluster management, there is a natural flow that we are uanble
to encapsulate in juju, which is to update a node with its set of peers.

Presently, when a node has joined the cluster: the state of the system is kept
entirely within the raft log.
