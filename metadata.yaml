description: |
  A highly-available key value store for shared configuration and service
  discovery. etcd is inspired by Apache ZooKeeper and doozer, with a 
  focus on being:

   Simple: curl'able user facing API (HTTP+JSON)
   Secure: optional SSL client cert authentication
   Fast: benchmarked 1000s of writes/s per instance
   Reliable: properly distributed using Raft

  etcd is written in Go and uses the Raft consensus algorithm to manage 
  a highly-available replicated log.
